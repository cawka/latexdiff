to build the package :

#if you are reading this file, you should not need this...
#debcheckout git://git.debian.org/git/users/munga-guest/latexdiff.git

# atm we don't have any debian specific patches neither upstream paches,
# so we can skip this step.
# debian/rules tg-export

# since I've uncommited files in my master branch, I need to use --git-ignore-new
# moreover the we should not specify buildarea in .gbp.conf
git-buildpackage --git-pristine-tar --git-ignore-new
