.IX Title "LATEXDIFF 1"
.TH LATEXDIFF 1 "2007-10-19" "perl v5.8.0" " "
.SH "NAME"
latexdiff \- determine and markup differences between two latex files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBlatexdiff\fR [ \fB\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR ] \fIold.tex\fR \fInew.tex\fR > \fIdiff.tex\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Briefly, \fIlatexdiff\fR is a utility program to aid in the management of
revisions of latex documents. It compares two valid latex files, here
called \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR, finds significant differences
between them (i.e., ignoring the number of white spaces and position
of line breaks), and adds special commands to highlight the
differences.  Where visual highlighting is not possible, e.g. for changes
in the formatting, the differences are
nevertheless marked up in the source.
.PP
The program treats the preamble differently from the main document.
Differences between the preambles are found using line-based
differencing (similarly to the Unix diff command, but ignoring white
spaces).  A comment, "\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ >\*(C'\fR" is appended to each added line, i.e. a 
line present in \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR but not in \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR.  Discarded lines 
 are deactivated by prepending "\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ <\*(C'\fR". Changed blocks are preceded  by
comment lines giving information about line numbers in the original files.  Where there are insignificant
differences, the resulting file \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR will be similar to
\&\f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR.  At the end of the preamble, the definitions for \fIlatexdiff\fR markup commands are inserted.
In differencing the main body of the text, \fIlatexdiff\fR attempts to
satisfy the following guidelines (in order of priority):
.IP "1" 3
.IX Item "1"
If both \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR are valid LaTeX, then the resulting
\&\f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR should also be valid LateX. (\s-1NB\s0 If a few plain TeX commands
are used within \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR then \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR is not
guaranteed to work but usually will).
.IP "2" 3
.IX Item "2"
Significant differences are determined on the level of
individual words. All significant differences, including differences
between comments should be clearly marked in the resulting source code
\&\f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR.
.IP "3" 3
.IX Item "3"
If a changed passage contains text or text-producing commands, then
running \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR through LateX should produce output where added
and discarded passages are highlighted.
.IP "4" 3
.IX Item "4"
Where there are insignificant differences, e.g. in the positioning of
line breaks, \f(CW\*(C`diff.tex\*(C'\fR should follow the formatting of \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR
.PP
For differencing the same algorithm as \fIdiff\fR is used but words
instead of lines are compared.  An attempt is made to recognize
blocks which are completely changed such that they can be marked up as a unit.
Comments are differenced line by line
but the number of spaces within comments is ignored. Commands including
all their arguments are generally compared as one unit, i.e., no mark-up
is inserted into the arguments of commands.  However, for a selected
number of commands (for example, \f(CW\*(C`\ecaption\*(C'\fR and all sectioning
commands) the last argument is known to be text. This text is
split into words and differenced just as ordinary text (use options to
show and change the list of text commands, see below). As the
algorithm has no detailed knowledge of LaTeX, it assumes all pairs of
curly braces immediately following a command (i.e. a sequence of
letters beginning with a backslash) are arguments for that command.
As a restriction to condition 1 above it is thus necessary to surround
all arguments with curly braces, and to not insert
extraneous spaces.  For example, write 
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \esection{\etextem{This is an emphasized section title}}
.Ve
.PP
and not
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \esection {\etextem{This is an emphasized section title}}
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \esection\etextem{This is an emphasized section title}
.Ve
.PP
even though all varieties are the same to LaTeX (but see
\&\fB\-\-allow\-spaces\fR option which allows the second variety).
.PP
For environments whose content does not conform to standard LaTeX or
where graphical markup does not make sense all markup commands can be
removed by setting the \s-1PICTUREENV\s0 configuration variable, set by
default to \f(CW\*(C`picture\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DIFnomarkup\*(C'\fR environments; see \fB\-\-config\fR
option).  The latter environment (\f(CW\*(C`DIFnomarkup\*(C'\fR) can be used to
protect parts of the latex file where the markup results in illegal
markup. You have to surround the offending passage in both the old and
new file by \f(CW\*(C`\ebegin{DIFnomarkup}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eend{DIFnomarkup}\*(C'\fR. You must
define the environment in the preambles of both old and new
documents. I prefer to define it as a null\-environment,
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`\enewenvironment{DIFnomarkup}{}{}\*(C'\fR
.PP
but the choice is yours.  Any markup within the environment will be
removed, and generally everything within the environment will just be
taken from the new file.
.PP
It is also possible to difference files which do not have a preamble. 
 In this case, the file is processed in the main document
mode, but the definitions of the markup commands are not inserted.
.PP
All markup commands inserted by \fIlatexdiff\fR begin with "\f(CW\*(C`\eDIF\*(C'\fR".  Added
blocks containing words, commands or comments which are in \f(CW\*(C`new.tex\*(C'\fR
but not in \f(CW\*(C`old.tex\*(C'\fR are marked by \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddend\*(C'\fR.
Discarded blocks are marked by \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelbegin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelend\*(C'\fR.
Within added blocks all text is highlighted with \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR like this:
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd{Added text block}\*(C'\fR
Selected `safe' commands can be contained in these text blocks as well
(use options to show and change the list of safe commands, see below).
All other commands as well as braces \*(L"{\*(R" and \*(L"}\*(R" are never put within
the scope of \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR.  Added comments are marked by prepending
"\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ >\ \*(C'\fR".
.PP
Within deleted blocks text is highlighted with \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR.  Deleted
comments are marked by prepending "\f(CW\*(C`%DIF\ <\ \*(C'\fR\*(L".  Non-safe command
and curly braces within deleted blocks are commented out with 
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`%DIFDELCMD\ <\ \*(C'\fR".
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"

The following options determine the visual markup style by adding the appropriate
command definitions to the preamble. See the end of this section for a description of 
available styles.
.IP "\fB\-\-type=markupstyle\fR or \fB\-t markupstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--type=markupstyle or -t markupstyle"
Add code to preamble for selected markup style. This option defines
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR commands.
Available styles: 
.Sp

[ Default: \f(CW\*(C`UNDERLINE\*(C'\fR ]
.IP "\fB\-\-subtype=markstyle\fR or \fB\-s markstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--subtype=markstyle or -s markstyle"
Add code to preamble for selected style for bracketing
commands (e.g. to mark changes in  margin). This option defines
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddend\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelbegin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdelend\*(C'\fR commands.
Available styles: \f(CW\*(C`SAFE MARGINAL DVIPSCOL\*(C'\fR
.Sp
[ Default: \f(CW\*(C`SAFE\*(C'\fR ]
.IP "\fB\-\-floattype=markstyle\fR or \fB\-f markstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--floattype=markstyle or -f markstyle"
Add code to preamble for selected style which 
replace standard marking and markup commands within floats
(e.g., marginal remarks cause an error within floats
so marginal marking can be disabled thus). This option defines all 
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIF...FL\*(C'\fR commands.
Available styles: \f(CW\*(C`FLOATSAFE TRADITIONALSAFE IDENTICAL\*(C'\fR
.Sp
[ Default: \f(CW\*(C`FLOATSAFE\*(C'\fR ]
.IP "\fB\-\-encoding=enc\fR or \fB\-e enc\fR" 4
.IX Item "--encoding=enc or -e enc"
Specify encoding of old.tex and new.tex. Typical encodings are
\&\f(CW\*(C`ascii\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`latin1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`latin9\*(C'\fR.  A list of available encodings can be 
obtained by executing 
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-MEncode \-e 'print join ("\en",Encode\-\*(C'\fRencodings( \*(L":all\*(R" )) ;' >
.Sp
[Default encoding is utf8 unless the first few lines of the preamble contain
an invocation \f(CW\*(C`\eusepackage[..]{inputenc}\*(C'\fR in which case the 
encoding chosen by this command is asssumed. Note that \s-1ASCII\s0 (standard
latex) is a subset of utf8]
.IP "\fB\-\-preamble=file\fR or \fB\-p file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--preamble=file or -p file"
Insert file at end of preamble instead of generating
preamble.  The preamble must define the following commands
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin, \eDIFaddend, \eDIFadd{..},
\&\eDIFdelbegin,\eDIFdelend,\eDIFdel{..},\*(C'\fR
and varieties for use within floats
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbeginFL, \eDIFaddendFL, \eDIFaddFL{..},
\&\eDIFdelbeginFL, \eDIFdelendFL, \eDIFdelFL{..}\*(C'\fR
(If this option is set \fB\-t\fR, \fB\-s\fR, and \fB\-f\fR options
are ignored.)
.IP "\fB\-\-packages=pkg1,pkg2,..\fR" 4
.IX Item "--packages=pkg1,pkg2,.."
Tell latexdiff that .tex file is processed with the packages in list
loaded.  This is normally not necessary if the .tex file includes the
preamble, as the preamble is automatically scanned for \f(CW\*(C`\eusepackage\*(C'\fR commands.
Use of the \fB\-\-packages\fR option disables automatic scanning, so if for any
reason package specific parsing needs to be switched off, use \fB\-\-packages=none\fR.
The following packages trigger special behaviour:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """amsmath""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWamsmath\fR" 8
.IX Item "amsmath"
Configuration variable amsmath is set to \f(CW\*(C`align*\*(C'\fR (Default: \f(CW\*(C`eqnarray*\*(C'\fR)
.ie n .IP """endfloat""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWendfloat\fR" 8
.IX Item "endfloat"
Ensure that \f(CW\*(C`\ebegin{figure}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eend{figure}\*(C'\fR always appear by themselves on a line.
.ie n .IP """hyperref""" 8
.el .IP "\f(CWhyperref\fR" 8
.IX Item "hyperref"
Change name of \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR commands to \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddtex\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdeltex\*(C'\fR and 
define new \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR commands, which provide a wrapper for these commands,
using them for the text but not for the link defining command (where any markup would cause
errors).

Exclude from, replace or append to the list of regular expressions (RegEx)
matching commands which are safe to use within the 
scope of a \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel\*(C'\fR command.  The file must contain
one Perl-RegEx per line (Comment lines beginning with # or % are
ignored).  Note that the RegEx needs to match the whole of 
the token, i.e., /^regex$/ is implied and that the initial
\&\*(L"\e\*(R" of the command is not included. 
The \fB\-\-exclude\-safecmd\fR and \fB\-\-append\-safecmd\fR options can be combined with the \-\fB\-\-replace\-safecmd\fR 
option and can be used repeatedly to add cumulatively to the lists.
 \fB\-\-exclude\-safecmd\fR
and \fB\-\-append\-safecmd\fR can also take a comma separated list as input. If a
comma for one of the regex is required, escape it thus \*(L"\e,\*(R". In most cases it
will be necessary to protect the comma-separated list from the shell by putting
it in quotation marks.

.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-warnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-warnings"
Suppress warnings about inconsistencies in length between input and
parsed strings and missing characters.  These warning messages are
often related to non-standard latex or latex constructions with a
syntax unknown to \f(CW\*(C`latexdiff\*(C'\fR but the resulting difference argument
is often fully functional anyway, particularly if the non-standard
latex only occurs in parts of the text which have not changed.
.IP "\fB\-\-allow\-spaces\fR" 4
.IX Item "--allow-spaces"
Allow spaces between bracketed or braced arguments to commands.  Note
that this option might have undesirable side effects (unrelated scope
might get lumpeded with preceding commands) so should only be used if the
default produces erroneous results.  (Default requires arguments to
directly follow each other without intervening spaces).
.IP "\fB\-\-flatten\fR" 4
.IX Item "--flatten"
Replace \f(CW\*(C`\einput\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\einclude\*(C'\fR commands within body by the content
of the files in their argument.  If \f(CW\*(C`\eincludeonly\*(C'\fR is present in the
preamble, only those files are expanded into the document. However, 
no recursion is done, i.e. \f(CW\*(C`\einput\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\einclude\*(C'\fR commands within 
included sections are not expanded.  The included files are assumed to 
 be located in the same directories as the old and new master files,
respectively, making it possible to organise files into old and new directories. 
.Sp
Use of this option is not recommended
primarily the processing time for the large documents is prohibitive, and
the resulting difference document no longer reflects the structure of the 
input documents. 
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR or \fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help or -h"

.Sh "Predefined styles"
.IX Subsection "Predefined styles"
.Sh "Major types"
.IX Subsection "Major types"
The major type determine the markup of plain text and some selected latex commands outside floats by defining the markup commands \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFadd{...}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFdel{...}\*(C'\fR .
.ie n .IP """UNDERLINE""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWUNDERLINE\fR" 10
.IX Item "UNDERLINE"
Added text is wavy-underlined and blue, discarded text is struck out and red
(Requires color and ulem packages).  Overstriking does not work in displayed math equations such that deleted parts of equation are underlined, not struck out (this is a shortcoming inherent to the ulem package).
.ie n .IP """CTRADITIONAL""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWCTRADITIONAL\fR" 10
.IX Item "CTRADITIONAL"
Added text is blue and set in sans\-serif, and a red footnote is created for each discarded 
piece of text. (Requires color package)
.ie n .IP """TRADITIONAL""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWTRADITIONAL\fR" 10
.IX Item "TRADITIONAL"
Like \f(CW\*(C`CTRADITIONAL\*(C'\fR but without the use of color.
.ie n .IP """CFONT""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWCFONT\fR" 10
.IX Item "CFONT"
Added text is blue and set in sans\-serif, and discarded text is red and very small size.
.ie n .IP """FONTSTRIKE""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWFONTSTRIKE\fR" 10
.IX Item "FONTSTRIKE"
Added tex is set in sans\-serif, discarded text small and struck out
.ie n .IP """CCHANGEBAR""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWCCHANGEBAR\fR" 10
.IX Item "CCHANGEBAR"
Added text is blue, and discarded text is red.  Additionally, the changed text is marked with a bar in the margin (Requires color and changebar packages).
.ie n .IP """CFONTCHBAR""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWCFONTCHBAR\fR" 10
.IX Item "CFONTCHBAR"
Like \f(CW\*(C`CFONT\*(C'\fR but with additional changebars (Requires color and changebar packages).
.ie n .IP """CULINECHBAR""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWCULINECHBAR\fR" 10
.IX Item "CULINECHBAR"
Like \f(CW\*(C`UNDERLINE\*(C'\fR but with additional changebars (Requires color, ulem and changebar packages).
.ie n .IP """CHANGEBAR""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWCHANGEBAR\fR" 10
.IX Item "CHANGEBAR"
No mark up of text, but mark margins with changebars (Requires changebar package).
.ie n .IP """INVISIBLE""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWINVISIBLE\fR" 10
.IX Item "INVISIBLE"
No visible markup (but generic markup commands will still be inserted.
.Sh "Subtypes"
.IX Subsection "Subtypes"
The subtype defines the commands that are inserted at the begin and end of added or discarded blocks, irrespectively of whether these blocks contain text or commands (Defined commands: \f(CW\*(C`\eDIFaddbegin, \eDIFaddend, \eDIFdelbegin, \eDIFdelend\*(C'\fR) 
.ie n .IP """SAFE""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWSAFE\fR" 10
.IX Item "SAFE"
No additional markup (Recommended choice)
.ie n .IP """MARGIN""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWMARGIN\fR" 10
.IX Item "MARGIN"
Mark beginning and end of changed blocks with symbols in the margin nearby (using
the standard \f(CW\*(C`\emarginpar\*(C'\fR command \- note that this sometimes moves somewhat
from the intended position.
.ie n .IP """DVIPSCOL""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWDVIPSCOL\fR" 10
.IX Item "DVIPSCOL"
An alternative way of marking added passages in blue, and deleted ones in red. Note
that \f(CW\*(C`DVIPSCOL\*(C'\fR only works with the dvips converter, e.g. not pdflatex.
(it is recommeneded to use instead the main types to effect colored markup,
although in some cases coloring with dvipscol can be more complete).
.Sh "Float Types"
.IX Subsection "Float Types"
Some of the markup used in the main text might cause problems when used within 
floats (e.g. figures or tables).  For this reason alternative versions of all
markup commands are used within floats. The float type defines these alternative commands.
.ie n .IP """FLOATSAFE""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWFLOATSAFE\fR" 10
.IX Item "FLOATSAFE"
Use identical markup for text as in the main body, but set all commands marking the begin and end of changed blocks to null\-commands.  You have to choose this float type if your subtype is \f(CW\*(C`MARGIN\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`\emarginpar\*(C'\fR does not work properly within floats.
.ie n .IP """TRADITIONALSAFE""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWTRADITIONALSAFE\fR" 10
.IX Item "TRADITIONALSAFE"
Mark additions the same way as in the main text.  Deleted environments are marked by angular brackets \e[ and \e] and the deleted text is set in scriptscript size. This float type should always be used with the \f(CW\*(C`TRADITIONAL\*(C'\fR and  \f(CW\*(C`CTRADITIONAL\*(C'\fR markup types as the \efootnote command does not work properly in floating environments.
.ie n .IP """IDENTICAL""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWIDENTICAL\fR" 10
.IX Item "IDENTICAL"
Make no difference between the main text and floats.
.Sh "Configuration Variables"
.IX Subsection "Configuration Variables"
.ie n .IP """MINWORDSBLOCK""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWMINWORDSBLOCK\fR" 10
.IX Item "MINWORDSBLOCK"
Minimum number of tokens required to form an independent block. This value is
used in the algorithm to detect changes of complete blocks by merging identical text parts of less than \f(CW\*(C`MINWORDSBLOCK\*(C'\fR to the preceding added and discarded parts.
.Sp

.ie n .IP """FLOATENV""" 10
.el .IP "\f(CWFLOATENV\fR" 10
.IX Item "FLOATENV"
Environments whose name matches the regular expression in \f(CW\*(C`FLOATENV\*(C'\fR are 
considered floats.  Within these environments, the \fIlatexdiff\fR markup commands
are replaced by their \s-1FL\s0 variaties.

.IX Item "PICTUREENV"
Within environments whose name matches the regular expression in \f(CW\*(C`PICTUREENV\*(C'\fR
all latexdiff markup is removed (in pathologic cases this might lead to
 inconsistent markup but this situation should be rare).

.IX Item "MATHENV,MATHREPL"
If both \ebegin and \eend for a math environment (environment name matching \f(CW\*(C`MATHENV\*(C'\fR
or \e[ and \e])
are within the same deleted block, they are replaced by a \ebegin and \eend commands for \f(CW\*(C`MATHREPL\*(C'\fR

.el .IP "\f(CWARRENV\fR" 10
.IX Item "ARRENV"
If a match to \f(CW\*(C`ARRENV\*(C'\fR is found within an inline math environment within a deleted or added block, then the inlined math 
is surrounded by \f(CW\*(C`\embox{\*(C'\fR...\f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR.  This is necessary as underlining does not work within inlined array environments.

\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 support requires a relatively new version of perl (5.8.0 is sufficient

Option allow-spaces not implemented entirely consistently. It breaks
the rules that number and type of white space does not matter, as
different numbers of inter-argument spaces are treated as significant.

Please send bug reports
to \fItilmann@esc.cam.ac.uk\fR.  Include the serial number of \fIlatexdiff\fR
