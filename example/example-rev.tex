\section*{Introduction}

This is an extremely simple document that showcases some of the latexdiff features.
Type
\begin{verbatim}
latexdiff -t UNDERLINE example-draft.tex example-rev.tex > example-diff.tex
\end{verbatim}
to create the difference file.  You can inspect this file directly. Then run either 
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex example-diff.tex
xpdf example-diff.pdf
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
latex example-diff.tex
dvips -o example-diff.ps example-diff.dvi
gv example-diff.ps
\end{verbatim}
to display the markup.

\section*{Yet another section title}

 More things could be said were it not for the constraints of time and space.

A paragraph with a line only in the revised document.  More things could be 
said were it not for the constraints of time and space.

And here is a typo. 

Here is a table:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Name & Description \\
\hline
Gandalf & White \\
Saruman & Evil
\end{tabular}

And now for something completely different, with not a paragraph in sight.
No change, 
no markup!
